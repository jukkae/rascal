# RASCAL: a Roguelike

Rascal is a post-apocalyptic science fiction roguelike.

## Compilation
Currently macOS only.

### Set up a clean machine

1. Install SFML with homebrew.
2. Install boost with homebrew.
3. Run `mkdir obj` â€“ this should ideally be in `makefile`.
4. Clone https://github.com/auriamg/macdylibbundler.git to ../ and run make there
5. Run `mkdir frameworks` and copy SFML framework files there. It's likely this is redundant, but this needs to be looked into later.

### Building bundle

When running `make bundle`, it's possible that macdylibbundler complains `/!\ WARNING : can't get path for '@rpath/libsfml-system.2.4.dylib'`. If this happens, the quickest workaround is to just paste a zillion times `/usr/local/lib`. Should fix this at some point. It's entirely possible that there's something wrong with the whole `rpath` thing here.

## Dependencies
- SFML 2.4.2
- Boost 1.65.1
