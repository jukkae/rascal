# RASCAL: a Roguelike

Rascal is a post-apocalyptic science fiction roguelike.

## Compilation
Currently macOS only.

### Set up a clean machine

1. Install SFML with homebrew.
2. Install boost with homebrew.
3. Run `mkdir obj` â€“ this should ideally be in `makefile`.
4. On macOS, clone https://github.com/rkitover/mac-third-party-libs-tool to ../
5. Run `mkdir frameworks` and copy SFML framework files there. It's likely this is redundant, but this needs to be looked into later.

### Building with Meson

```
$ mkdir build
$ meson build
$ ninja -C build build OR $ ninja -C build bundle
```

## Dependencies
- SFML 2.4.2 or higher
- Boost 1.65.1 or higher
